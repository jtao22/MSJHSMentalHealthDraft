				<h1> If you have been cutting and want to find ways to stop/alternatives, we've provided a few of the most accessible ones below. </h1>
			</div>
			<div class="profile-content-wrapper-altbod">
				<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">Before we start, we wanted to let you know that it's okay to not be able to replace self harm immediately. Life is throwing a lot at you, and it's only healthy to go one step at a time. You are definitely not incompetent or bad for not being able to make such a quick shift, and you definitely aren't alone in this struggle to succeed in this harsh yet rewarding abstract we call life.</p>
				<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">We feel the urge to cut and self harm because these things release endorphins, they make us feel good. They make some feel like, if anything, at least there is one thing in their lives that they can control. Some feel as though they deserve the pain. Others feel good during and after cutting. Since endorphins play such a huge role in the appeal of self harm, some of the best alternatives are also endorphin-releasing activities. We'd also like to state that alternatives are not limited to just the ones we have listed; endorphins are most commonly triggered by stress and pain, so any activity that positively incorporates one or both of the two is an amazing substitute to self harm.</p>
				<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">Exercising (pushups, crunches, running, etc.) is perhaps the most frequently seen alternative. Other activities include getting a massage, taking a hot bubble bath, eating chocolate or spicy foods (spicy chips, salsa, peppers, LAO GAN MA), and even an oh so frequently overlooked activity as laughing can do the trick. For those of you who have access to a wider amount of resources, acupunture and aromatherapy are potential alternatives. </p>
			<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:50px;">NOW, time for a wildcard! :) One uncommon yet extremely underrated surrogate for cutting is to put an ice cube on the area you intend to cut. Yeah, sounds strange, but putting an ice cube on the target area does release endorphins, except now your safety is not as jeopardized, and there won't be scars afterwards. </p>
